      <dd>Classic Car - original oil painting for sale by artist</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This is an original oil painting on canvas board.</p>
<p>Don't you wish that this car was sitting in your garage? Well, you can have this painting of
this beautiful car on your desk or on the wall.</p>
<p>With the included frame, this painting is 6&frac12; inches by 6&frac12; inches. Without the
frame, the painting is 4 inches by 4 inches.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>
