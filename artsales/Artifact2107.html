      <dd><p>This painting portrays a little girl picking wild flowers in
a field on a Spring day.</p>
<p>I used bright reds, soft blues, and various green hues to emphasize the purity and vibrancy of
this scene.</p>
<p>This is a peaceful pastoral scene under a calm blue sky. The pasture is brimming with life.  I
love painting these scenes.  I grew up in the country and I still enjoy visting the country-side.
</p>
<p>This painting includes a frame and measures 14 inches by 11 inches.  It was created using oil
paints on masonite.</p>
<p>This is a signed original painting.  It is not a print.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>
