      <dd>Harvesting Grain in the 19th Century - original watercolor painting</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This watercolor illustrates a group of farmers peacefully
stacking grain and straw on a horse-drawn wagon.</p>
<p>This quiet scene was once common in North America. Today, the graceful horses have been replaced
with loud, bulky tractors, and instead of 4 farmers working together there is usually only one 
person operating massive machinery all by himself.</p>
<p>This signed original is on 140 lb acid-free paper. The painting measures 11" by 9" but there is
a &frac12;" border around the painting on all sides. The matte is not included.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>
