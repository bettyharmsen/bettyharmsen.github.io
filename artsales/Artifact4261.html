      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This signed original water-color painting shows a fish-pond
in a very natural setting.  In the background is a cat looking to pluck an easy meal from its 
depths.</p>
<p>This painting is not a photocopy or a print.  It is a pleasing painting with many vivid colors.
It would look great on any wall.</p>
<p>This cheerful watercolor painting was done on 145 lb acid-free watercolor paper. The picture is
12 inches by 9&#189; inches.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>
