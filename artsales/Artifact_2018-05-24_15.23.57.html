      <dd>Old Town in Holland - original oil painting for sale by artist</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>I painted and signed this original watercolour painting. THIS IS NOT A PRINT.</p>
<p>This painting shows an old Dutch town like the one I grew up in long ago.</p><p>It is in the primitive style which I feel helps emphasize the beauty of simpler times.</p>
<p>I used bright, clean colors to highlight the purity of this scene. The sky is clear blue, the
trees are deep green, and the snow is a pristine white. </p>
<p>This painting is on watercolour paper. This painting is ready-to-hang.</p>
<p>The dimensions, including frame, are 15 &frac14; inches wide by 12 &frac14; inches high.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>
