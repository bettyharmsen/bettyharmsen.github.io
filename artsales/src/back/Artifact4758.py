<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p>"""
