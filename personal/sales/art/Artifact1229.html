      <dd>Playing in the Pumpkin Patch - original watercolor painting for sale by artist</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This signed original watercolor painting depicts a child
playing in a pumpkin pitch.  This painting is a pleasant reminder that children can have fun
without television or video games.</p>
<p>This cheerful watercolor painting was done on 140 lb acid-free watercolor paper. The picture 
itself is 9&frac12; inches by 8&frac12; inches but it is painted on a 10&frac12; inch by 9&frac12;
inch sheet.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>
