      <dd>Village In The Country - original oil painting for sale by artist</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This is an original oil painting. This is the only painting 
I have made of this subject.  This is not a print.</p>
<p>This picture depicts a charming old-fashioned village that is busy with shoppers and kids
playing in the streets without fear of heavy traffic.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>

      <dd>Original oil painting on canvas - Village in the Country</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This is an original oil painting. This is the only painting I
have made of this subject. This is not a print.</p>
<p>This picture depicts a charming old-fashioned village that is busy with shoppers and kids
playing in the streets without fear of heavy traffic.</p>
<p>The painting itself is on a 14 by 11 inch canvas. This painting wraps around the edges. The
staples are on the back. This painting looks great without a frame.</p>
<p>I have been painting and drawing since I was a little girl in Holland. I now live in Canada.</p>
<p>I really love paintings that depict simple rural scenes and 19th century life. I prefer to use
lively, vibrant colors - even in peaceful scenes.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to view this painting.</p>
