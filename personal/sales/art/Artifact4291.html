      <dd>Amish Barn Raising - original oil painting for sale by artist</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This is a signed original painting.  This painting portrays a
group of Amish farmers getting together to raise a barn.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how they managed to put up a barn without the help of a modern crane to lift
those heavy beams?  Luckily neighbors and friends came in droves to give a helping hand and enjoy
the opportunity to socialize and feast on the meals the Amish women provided.</p>
<p>This oil painting is on canvas board.  Its size is 15 inches by 12 inches including the frame.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years 
before discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay,
Etsy, Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p></dd>
