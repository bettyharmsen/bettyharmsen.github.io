      <dd>Amish Families Going to Market - Original watercolor painting for sale by artist</dd>
      <dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd><p>This painting shows two Amish families traveling in different
carriages. Perhaps they are going to the market or some gathering. One could imagine this same 
scene playing out a century earlier, if it weren't for the hint of modernity in the background.</p>
<p>This is a watercolor painting on 140 lbs acid-free paper. The size of this painting with matte
and frame are 11 by 13 inches.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been doodling and drawing whenever I found some scrap paper or anything
else that I could use. I had been working in watercolors and oils for more than thirty years before
discovering folk-art.</p>
<p>I fell in love with folk-art when I had first seen the paintings of Grandma Moses. The 
simplicity and the cheerful colors were so appealing to me that I had made up my mind to try it.
</p>
<p>I have been creating folk-art for twenty years and I have sold many of these works on eBay, Etsy
Kijiji and in various galleries in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my art.</p>
<p>I hope you are just as pleased to see this painting as I was to paint it.</p>
